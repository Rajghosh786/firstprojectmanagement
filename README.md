Description of Project board - We created a project board in which we created three columns To Do, In Progress, Done this will help to track the progress of the task which was given to us like if we started something and not yet ended we can move that task to pending column, and if a task has completed we can move it to completed column now this will help us to day to day working like we dont have to look back to the task which has been already been completed this board will help and ensure the project task and functionaing is in smooth manner and are completed before the time line


Reflection - github is a version control system where many developers collab to create a project providing tools like the milestones, issues tab and project boards really helps to keep a track of the project because making this kinds of project is not a single day's work and after working for like 3-4 month on the same project nobody can remember the project history and state so using boards to create a task list and mentioning the task in a systematic manner after completion or in progress or yet to be started helps achieve goals before deadline creating milestones helps us organize which milestone has been achieved and divide the task in small manner and creating board according to that, we can also raise a issue and label them a bug, asking for help, feature etc to create awareness of the project to the team so that they wont have to stuck on something and waste time maybe some small part of the project like removing a function or adding a function comes up we can raise a issue for that
